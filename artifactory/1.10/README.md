# How to use Artifactory on DC/OS

Currently you are only able to use licensed versions of Artifactory on DC/OS. To
get a trial license, go to [JFrog's
website](https://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/free-trial-mesosphere/).

Artifactory requires a database named `artdb` made available (MySQL, Oracle, MS
SQL Server or Postgres). To set up a testing instance of MySQL on DC/OS, see
[this guide](install-mysql.md).

Once you have a database available, see the following guides to install the
correct version of Artifactory:

+ For Artifactory Pro, follow [this guide](artifactory-pro.md).
+ For Artifactory Enterprise, follow [this guide](artifactory-enterprise.md).
