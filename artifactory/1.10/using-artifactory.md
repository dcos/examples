## How to use Artifactory on DC/OS as a Docker Registry


## Prerequisites

- [DC/OS CLI installed](https://dcos.io/docs/1.10/usage/cli/install/) and configured to use your cluster
- A running installation of [Artifactory Pro](artifactory-pro.md) or
  [Artifactory Enterprise](artifactory-enterprise.md) on DC/OS
- [Artifactory-lb](artifactory-lb.md) installed with appropriate certificates
  (or configured as an insecure registry, see below)
- Ports 5000 to 5010 open on the public agent where Artifactory-lb is running.

### (Optional) Configuring Artifactory as an insecure registry

In case you'd like to run an insecure registry without using any TLS
certificates, you can configure the nodes in your DC/OS cluster to work without
certificates or security.

This basically tells the Docker engine in each node to entirely disregard
security for your registry. While this is relatively easy to configure the
daemon in this way, it is very insecure. It does expose your registry to trivial
MITM. Only use this solution for isolated testing or in a tightly controlled,
air-gapped environment.

Run this in all agent nodes of your cluster:

```
sudo cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service /etc/systemd/system/docker.service

sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/docker.service

add this line: Environment="DOCKER_OPTS=--insecure-registry artifactory-lb.marathon.mesos:5001”

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

sudo systemctl restart docker.service
```

## Pushing a Docker image to Artifactory

First, you'll need to login to the registry:

```
docker login artifactory-lb.marathon.mesos:5001
```

Then build an image and push it to the registry:

```
docker build . --tag artifactory-lb.marathon.mesos/<image name>
docker push artifactory-lb.marathon.mesos:5000/<image name>
```

## Deploying a Docker image from Artifactory

The Docker registry at `artifactory-lb.marathon.mesos:5001` is now available for
use in your Marathon applications. It can be used to launch applications from
the GUI or the CLI interfaces.

### From the Marathon UI

Simply use ```artifactory-lb.marathon.mesos:5001``` as a prefix in the
`Container Settings`/`Container Image` field of the `Services` form:

![Usage: From UI](img/usage_from_ui.png)

Launch your application normally and check it’s working correctly in the “Services” tab:

![Usage: Services View](img/usage_services_view.png)

Check cached image in Artifactory UI

#### From the CLI

Write a JSON file that uses the image from Artifactory:

```
$cat registry-example-app.json
{
  "id": "/artifactory-registry-docker-example",
  "cmd": null,
  "cpus": 1,
  "mem": 128,
  "disk": 0,
  "instances": 1,
  "executor": null,
  "fetch": null,
  "constraints": null,
  "acceptedResourceRoles": null,
  "user": null,
  "container": {
    "docker": {
      "image": "artifactory-lb.marathon.mesos:5001/nginx",
      "forcePullImage": false,
      "privileged": false,
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "containerPort": 80,
          "protocol": "tcp",
          "name": "http"
        }
      ],
      "network": "BRIDGE"
    }
  },
  "labels": null,
  "healthChecks": null,
  "env": null
}
```

Load that JSON into Marathon:

```
dcos marathon app add registry-example-app.json
```

Check that the application is running properly:

```
$ dcos marathon app list
ID                                    MEM   CPUS  TASKS  HEALTH  DEPLOYMENT  CONTAINER  CMD

/artifactory-lb                       1024   1     1/1    1/1       ---        DOCKER   None  
/artifactory-registry-docker-example  128    1     1/1    ---       ---        DOCKER   None  
/mysql                                512   0.3    1/1    1/1       ---        DOCKER   None  
/universe                             128   0.25   1/1    1/1       ---        DOCKER   None  ```
```
