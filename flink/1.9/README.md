# How to use Apache Flink on DC/OS

[Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) is an open source platform for distributed stream and batch data processing. Apache Flink comes with native Mesos support and can be also installed a DC/OS service

- Estimated time for completion: 5 minutes
- Target audience: Data engineers; basic knowledge of Apache Flink and DC/OS is helpful, but not required.
- Scope: Install and use Flink.

- [Use Apache Flink](#use-flink)
- [Uninstall Apache Flink](#uninstall-flink)

## Prerequisites

- A running DC/OS 1.9 cluster with 1 agents with each 2 CPU and 2 GB of RAM available.
- [DC/OS CLI](https://dcos.io/docs/1.9/usage/cli/install/) installed.

## Install Flink

To install Apache Flink, do:

```bash
$ dcos package install flink
This DC/OS Service is currently in preview. There may be bugs, incomplete features, incorrect documentation, or other discrepancies. Flink requires by default 2 CPUs with 2GB of RAM on private nodes.
Continue installing? [yes/no] yes
Installing Marathon app for package [flink] version [1.2.0-1.0]
DC/OS Flink is being installed!

	Documentation: https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.2/
```

After this, you should see the Flink service running via the `Services` tab of the DC/OS UI:

### Scala 2.11

Note, that the default build of Apache Flink and this universe package are both using Scala 2.10.

If you require Scala 2.11 please use the following install option from the UI (or via options.json when using the CLI):

## Use Flink

NOTE: In order to have better access to the input and output files, it makes sense to store those in HDFS.

### Flink UI
In the following we will use the DC/OS [Admin Router](https://dcos.io/docs/1.9/development/dcos-integration/#-a-name-adminrouter-a-admin-router) to provide access to the Flink UI: use the URL `http://$DCOS_DASHBOARD/service/flink/` and replace `$DCOS_DASHBOARD` with the URL of your DC/OS UI. Alternatively, you can also klick `Open Service` in the DC/OS UI. The Flink dashboard UI looks like below.

![Flink Dashboard](img/dashboard.png)

Let us start our first job by going to `Submit new Job` in the Flink UI. We first need to add the respective jar file. For this example we will use the WordCount example jar file which can be found in `flink/build-target/examples/batch/WordCount.jar`.

Next, we can define our job as shown below:

![Submit Flink Job](img/submit.png)

After the job has finished we should be able to see some details about the WordCount job:

![Finished Flink Job](img/finished.png)

### Flink CLI from container

We can alternetively use the native Flink CLI from a docker container.
Therefore we need to know the Jobmanager rpc adress and port which can be retrieved from the Flink UI:

![Job Manager](img/jobmanager-rpc.png)

```bash
$ dcos node ssh --master-proxy --leader

core@ip-10-0-6-55 ~ $ docker run -it mesosphere/dcos-flink:1.2.0-1.2 /bin/bash

root@2a9c01d3594e:/flink-1.2.0# ./bin/flink run -m <jobmangerhost>:<jobmangerjobmanager.rpc.port> ./examples/batch/WordCount.jar --input file:///etc/resolv.conf --output file:///etc/wordcount_out
```

### DC/OS Flink CLI
Coming soon.


## Uninstall Flink

To uninstall Flink:

```bash
$ dcos package uninstall flink
```
