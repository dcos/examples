If you're a SaaS customer, that is reporting to the US environment, the rest of the values can be left with the default values. EU - SaaS customers should **switch to the "saas-eu-west-1.instana.io" endpoint**. If you're an on-prem customer, please **enter your backend's host address** and **set the port** (default: 1444). 


If desired you can **set host tags** in the tag list (comma separated).

If desired you can also **set an agent zone label**. 

At this point you'll want to review the configuration of the agent and click "Run Service".

## Scaling the Instana agent

This is being taken care of by the deployment constraints. If you have, say, three hosts, and set the scaling to three, DC/OS will deploy exactly one Instana agent on each host. If you want different host tags for each and every machine, the Instana agent needs to be deployed separately.

Click edit and then scale
