* **Estimated time for completion**: 2 minutes
* **Scope**: Learn how to install the Instana agent on a DC/OS Cluster.

## Prerequisites

* A running DC/OS 1.9 cluster
* Your Instana agent key (obtainable via the UMP menu in the Instana WebUI)

## Deploying the Instana agent

In order to install the Instana agent, go to the Universe listing in the DC/OS web UI, and **click on "Install"** on the Instana agent list item. Since you need to provide custom information, **click "Advanced Installation"**. The only required action here is to **fill in your Instana agent key**.

If you're a SaaS customer, that is reporting to the US environment, the rest of the values can be left with the default values. EU - SaaS customers should **switch to the "saas-eu-west-1.Instana.io" endpoint**. If you're an on-prem customer, please **enter your backend's host address** and **set the port** (default: 1444).

You can **set host tags** in the tag_list (comma separated). At this point you'll want to review you configuration of the agent and click "Review and install."

## Scaling the Instana agent

This is being taken care of by the deployment constraints. If you have, say, three hosts, and set the scaling to three, DC/OS will deploy exactly one Instana agent on each host. If you want different host tags for each and every machine, the Instana agent needs to be deployed separately.
