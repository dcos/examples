# How to use Koding on DC/OS

[Koding](https://www.koding.com/) is cloud development platform. Through the use of Stacks, you can define server environments which include all of the necessary software for you to develop your code. You can then deploy these stacks to your local Mesosphere DC/OS instance or to any of our supported cloud providers.

- Estimated time for completion: 10 minutes

## Prerequisites

- A running DC/OS 1.10 cluster with at least 1 [private
  agent](https://dcos.io/docs/1.10/overview/concepts/#public-agent-node)
  node with at least 2 CPUs and 8 GB of RAM available.
- [DC/OS CLI](https://dcos.io/docs/1.10/cli/install/) installed.

## Install Marathon-LB

To make Koding accessible from the public Internet, we will use [Marathon-LB](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon-lb), a HA-proxy-based load balancer for DC/OS. To install Marathon-LB from the DC/OS CLI, do:

```bash
$ dcos package install marathon-lb
We recommend at least 2 CPUs and 1GiB of RAM for each Marathon-LB instance.
Continue installing? [yes/no] yes
Installing Marathon app for package [marathon-lb] version [1.4.2]
Marathon-lb DC/OS Service has been successfully installed!
See https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon-lb for documentation.
```
Note that for advanced Marathon-LB configurations such as enabling HTTPS see the [Marathon-LB Quick Start](https://dcos.io/docs/1.10/usage/service-discovery/marathon-lb/quickstart/) guide.

After installation, you will also need to modify the Marathon-LB
installation to remove the haproxy-map property. Go to the Marathon-LB
service and then click edit. Switch to JSON mode. Under "args", remove
the line "--haproxy-map". Click "Review & Run" and then run the
service.

## Install Koding

To install Koding, login to DC/OS and go to the universe tab. Select
Koding and and then click on configure button. You will be presented
with a list of options.

Your first option will be what to name the Koding service. We suggest using the default of "koding".

You will then be able to allocate CPUs and memory in "koding" section.

You need to enter a hostname in the "networking" section. This
hostname is used within the Koding application to define where Koding
lives. Individual teams will live at subdomains of this hostname. It
mostly exists to be displayed inside the application, but should be
where you intend Koding to be accessed from. You may want to make a
CNAME record of this host and a wildcard record for any subdomains to
point to the FQDN you set up in the next step.

Lastly, to make Koding accessible to the world, we need to use the fully qualified domain name of the public agent node running marathon-lb or the load balancer pointing to your public agent nodes (for instance ```DCOS-PublicSlaveLo-1CHPNZSAH97SJ-604928754.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com```).

After all options are configured, press Review and Deploy and then Deploy to set up Koding.  Please note that it may take up to 10 minutes for the Koding service to become available.

Last but not least, to check if all required services (Marathon-LB and Koding itself) are running, use the DC/OS UI where in the `Services` tab you should see both Marathon-LB and Koding listed with their statuses as "Running".

## Access Koding

Once you've installed the necessary services as outlined above, navigate to the domain name that you set as your virtual host in your browser. You should now see the Koding login page.
