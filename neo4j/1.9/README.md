# How to use Neo4j on DC/OS

[Neo4j](https://www.neo4j.com/) is a highly scalable, native graph database purpose-built to leverage not only data but also its relationships. Neo4j's native graph storage and processing engine deliver constant, real-time performance, helping enterprises build intelligent applications to meet todayâ€™s evolving data challenges.

- Estimated time for completion: 5 minutes
- Target audience: Anyone who wants to deploy a clustered graph-model database on DC/OS. Beginner level.
- Scope: Covers the basics in order to get you started with Neo4j on DC/OS.

## Prerequisites

- A running DC/OS 1.9 cluster with at least 3 nodes having 3 CPU, 6GB of memory and 12GB of persistent disk storage in total. (Suggested: 3 nodes having 6 CPU, 24GB of memory and 24GB)
- [DC/OS CLI](https://dcos.io/docs/1.9/usage/cli/install/) installed.

## Install Neo4j

The DC/OS CLI provides a convenient way to deploy applications on your DC/OS cluster:

```
$ dcos package install neo4j
This DC/OS Service is currently in preview. There may be bugs, incomplete features, incorrect documentation, or other discrepancies. The default configuration requires at least 3 nodes having 6 CPU, 24GB of memory and 24GB of persistent disk storage in total. Default credentials are neo4j/dcos. Please change them on first use.
Continue installing? [yes/no] yes
Installing Marathon app for package [neo4j] version [3.1.2-1.0.0]
Neo4j has been successfully installed.
Documentation can be found at https://neo4j.com/docs and https://neo4j.com/developer
```

If you want to install read replica servers as well, please do:

```
$ dcos package install neo4j-replica
This DC/OS Service is currently in preview. There may be bugs, incomplete features, incorrect documentation, or other discrepancies. The default configuration requires at least 2 nodes having 4 CPU, 8GB of memory and 16GB of persistent disk storage in total.
Continue installing? [yes/no] yes
Installing Marathon app for package [neo4j-replica] version [3.1.2-1.0.0]
Neo4j has been successfully installed.
Documentation can be found at https://neo4j.com/docs and https://neo4j.com/developer
```



Now click on the Services tab in the DC/OS UI to watch Neo4j start up:

Click on the `Neo4j` group and the `core` App to reveal the tasks that the framework has started:

Congratulations, you now have Neo4j running on DC/OS!

## Public proxy for debugging purpose

If you want to access your Neo4j cluster from outside your DC/OS cluster, you need to install the public proxy:

```
$ dcos package install neo4j-proxy
This DC/OS Service is currently in preview. There may be bugs, incomplete features, incorrect documentation, or other discrepancies. Default credentials are neo4j/dcos. Please change them on first use.
Continue installing? [yes/no] yes
Installing Marathon app for package [neo4j-proxy] version [1.0.0-0.0.1]
Neo4j has been successfully installed.
Documentation can be found at https://neo4j.com/docs and https://neo4j.com/developer
```

After installation, point your web browser to the public IP of the agent running the proxy on port 7474. If you login (default: neo4j/dcos) and enter `:sysinfo` you will see all your running cluster nodes.

**Important:** Please check in the configuration sidebar `Do not use Bolt`. Only http via port 7474 is exported through this proxy, therefore the binary Bolt protocol is not working on the outside. Inside DC/OS Bolt works as expected.

## Scale Neo4j

To scale out your Neo4j cluster, just use the functionality in the DC/OS service section. Select either `neo4j/core` or `neo4j/replica` and do `Scale` and select the required numbers of instances.
