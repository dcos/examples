The following instruction will install Cassandra service on DC/OS cluster backed by PX volumes for persistent storage.


# Prerequisites

- A DC/OS v1.9 cluster with Portworx installed on at least 3 private agents
- Portworx works best when installed on all nodes in a DC/OS cluster.  If Portworx is to be installed on a subset of the cluster, then constraints must be used to specify the nodes where Portworx is installed
Portworx volumes.
- A node in the cluster with a working DC/OS CLI.

Please review the main [Portworx on DCOS](https://docs.portworx.com/scheduler/mesosphere-dcos/) documentation.

# Install Cassandra

cassandra-portworx package should be available under Universe->Packages

## Default Install
If you want to use the defaults, you can now run the dcos command to install the service
```
 $ dcos package install --yes cassandra-portworx
 ```
You can also click on the  “Install” button on the WebUI next to the service and then click “Install Package”.
This will install all the prerequisites and start a 3 node Cassandra cluster.

## Advanced Install
If you want to modify the defaults, click on the “Install” button next to the package on the DC/OS UI and then click on
“Advanced Installation”
![Cassandra Install Options](img/Cassandra-install-02.png)
This provides an option to change the service name, volume name, volume size, and provide any additional options that needs to be passed to Portworx volume.
Cassandra related parameters can also be modified, for example: number of Cassandra nodes.

Checking the Portworx's cluster will list multiple volumes that were automatically created using the options provided during install.
There will be one volume for each Cassandra node

Install Cassandra CLI using the following command on DC/OS client
```
 $ dcos package install cassandra-portworx --cli
Installing CLI subcommand for package [cassandra-portworx] version [stub-universe]
New command available: dcos cassandra-portworx
```
